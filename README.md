# Internship Day 2 ‚Äì Control Flow, Loops & Lists in Python

This repository documents the progress made on the second day of my internship, focusing on control flow, decision-making, loops, and basic data structures in Python. The day‚Äôs learning is structured using the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) format.

---


### ‚úÖ Situation
On Day 2 of my Python internship, I advanced from basic input/output operations to exploring decision-making, repetition, and list manipulation using core programming concepts in Python.

---

### ‚úÖ Task
The objective was to:
- Understand and apply control structures like `if`, `elif`, and `else`
- Implement logical and comparison operators for decision-making
- Practice loops (`while` and `for`) for iteration
- Build mini console-based programs such as a guess game and car simulation
- Learn basic operations on lists, including indexing, slicing, and nested structures

---

### ‚úÖ Action
To accomplish the goals, I worked on the following:

- Used **`if-else` statements** to create conditional logic in programs
- Applied **logical operators** (`and`, `or`, `not`) to build compound conditions
- Explored **comparison operators** to control program flow based on numeric and string inputs
- Built small real-life tasks like:
  - A **loan calculator** using boolean conditions
  - A **weight converter** with unit validation
  - A **name validator** using `len()` checks
- Practiced **`while` loops** for tasks like:
  - Repeated input attempts in a **guess game**
  - Drawing increasing patterns using string multiplication
  - Simulating a **text-based car control game**
- Utilized **`for` loops** to:
  - Calculate total cost from a list of items
  - Print index-based patterns using nested loops
- Worked with **lists and 2D lists**, and wrote logic to find the largest element and iterate over matrix structures

---

### ‚úÖ Result
- Successfully developed multiple interactive and logic-based mini-programs
- Strengthened understanding of conditions, loops, and list manipulation
- Learned to simulate real-world actions using fundamental control structures
- Became more confident with Python‚Äôs syntax, logic construction, and iteration patterns

## üåü Impact

The exercises from Day 2 provided the foundation for building real applications and solving logical problems. Key takeaways:

- **Problem-Solving Skills:** Built logic step-by-step using nested and compound conditions
- **Practical Coding:** Developed command-line-based games and tools to practice conditional logic and loops
- **Readability and Structure:** Gained exposure to structuring code for clarity and user interaction

This day established strong control over Python‚Äôs decision-making capabilities, preparing me for building reusable components and more dynamic programs.

## üîÆ Future To-Dos

Here are the areas I will explore in the next phase:

- Functions: defining, calling, and passing arguments
- Return values and reusable code blocks
- Error handling using `try` and `except`
- Dictionary usage and data manipulation
- Project: Building a simple contact book or calculator using what I‚Äôve learned

## üìÅ Repository Purpose

This repository serves as a documented log of my internship learning. Each day‚Äôs progress is structured clearly to reflect both theoretical understanding and practical implementation.
